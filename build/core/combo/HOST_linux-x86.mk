# Special case for the Linux SDK: We need to use a special cross-toolchain
# that generates machine code that will run properly on Ubuntu 8.04 (Hardy)
# By default, the code generated by the Lucid host toolchain will not run
# on previous versions of the platform, due to GLibc ABI mistmatches
# (Lucid is 2.11, Hardy is 2.7)
#
# Note that components that need to be built as 64-bit (e.g. clearsilver
# which is loaded by the 64-bit JVM through JNI), will have to use
# LOCAL_CC and LOCAL_CXX to override this.
